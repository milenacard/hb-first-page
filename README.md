# hb-first-page

This repository contains my first page web of practice, using flexbox and grid layout, using SASS as a CSS preprocessor and stylelint for SASS linting and CI.

Run `npm install`
After installing all the dependecies use `npm t` to run all the test.

Run in a development environment watching files with `npm start`.

Lint the .scss files with `npm run lint`.

Build an optimized CSS with `npm run build`.
